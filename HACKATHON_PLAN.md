# Wise Hackathon plan (09.06.2023)

This plan provides a structured approach to maximize our productivity and achieve our goals effectively. Aprox time constraints are there to keep us on track. (we don't have a lot of time to work on this)

Note: This plan is a guideline and can be adjusted as needed throughout the hackathon to accommodate unforeseen circumstances or opportunities for improvement.

## Phase 1: Brainstorming & Planning 10:45 - 12:00

- ### Introduction (10min)
    - Introduce and get comfortable with each other 
    - Tackle any quick questions about kood/JÃµhvi if needed
    - Introduce the issue and the proposed solution
    - Introduce this repository and its contents

- ### Learning outcomes (45min)
    - Identify target audience characteristics and consider their needs and aspirations.
    - Identify key concepts, skills, and knowledge areas essential for software development.
    - Create a list of learning outcomes for the module based on the previous discussions and agreements. (student centered learning outcomes are: measurable, concise, meaningful, achievable and outcome-based)
- ### General Task settings (20min)
    - Organize the learning outcomes in a logical and progressive manner to ensure a smooth learning progression.
    - Map out the learning outcomes between 4-7 tasks (depending on the amount of essential learning outcomes identified in the previous discussion).
    - Decide what technologies should be used: Javascript or Golang ecosystem
    - Go through [TASK_FORMAT.md](/tasks/TASK_FORMAT.md) & [AUDIT_FORMAT.md](/tasks/AUDIT_FORMAT.md) in a more detailed manner.
  

## Lunch Break  12:00 - 13:00

## Phase 2: Problem Solving 13:00 - 15:00
- ### Team formation (2min)
    - Do we split into 2-3 teams and focus on different tasks or we tackle each task together?

- ### Task creation (1h:45min)
    - Remembering that **quality over quantity**
    - High priority => Low priority

- ### Revision (13min)
    - Going through each created task as a team
