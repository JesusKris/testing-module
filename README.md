# Wise Hackathon Testing module

Welcome to the Wise Hackathon Testing Module repository, created specifically to address the software testing knowledge gap among kood/JÃµhvi students! ðŸš€

This module aims to empower students with practical software testing skills through a hands-on learning experience. 

Created during the Wise x kood/JÃµhvi Hackathon (09.06.2023)

## The Problem

The students at kood/JÃµhvi lack experience in software testing, a critical skill in today's technology-driven world. 

Without proper exposure to software testing concepts and practices, they face challenges in ensuring the quality and reliability of their software projects. 

This knowledge gap hinders their ability to create robust and error-free software solutions, limiting their potential for success in future careers or further education in the field of software development. 

Addressing this issue is crucial to empower kood/JÃµhvi students with the necessary skills and competencies in software testing, enabling them to build high-quality software applications and excel in the digital age.
