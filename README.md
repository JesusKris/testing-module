# Wise Hackathon Testing module

Welcome to the Wise Hackathon Testing Module repository, created specifically to address the software testing knowledge gap among kood/J√µhvi students! üöÄ

This module aims to empower students with practical software testing skills through a hands-on learning experience. 

Created during the Wise x kood/J√µhvi Hackathon (09.06.2023)

## The Problem

The students at kood/J√µhvi lack experience in software testing, a critical skill in today's technology-driven world. 

Without proper exposure to software testing concepts and practices, they face challenges in ensuring the quality and reliability of their software projects. 

This knowledge gap hinders their ability to create robust and error-free software solutions, limiting their potential for success in future careers or further education in the field of software development. 

Addressing this issue is crucial to empower kood/J√µhvi students with the necessary skills and competencies in software testing, enabling them to build high-quality software applications and excel in the digital age.

## Solution

This module on software testing should be taken early on, so that students benefit from the acquired skills in future modules (BE, FE, etc).  By the time the student gets to this, they will have been through the ‚Äúpiscine‚Äù and they will know basic data types, data manipulation, looping.

The module should be about 3-4 weeks, and contain maybe 4-7 tasks.

The learnings should be practical - tools that companies actually use.
