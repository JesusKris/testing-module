# Audits

### Audits play a crucial role in the kood/Jõhvi student community as a means for students to assess each other's projects. Here are key considerations for conducting effective audits:

- #### Accessibility: Audits should be designed to allow anyone, including those who haven't completed the task, to conduct the audit seamlessly. This ensures that the evaluation process remains unbiased and fair.

- #### Evaluation of Requirements: Audits should primarily focus on assessing whether the project has met the required requirements. This involves carefully examining the project's deliverables, functionalities, and outcomes to determine if they align with the specified criteria.

### By adhering to these principles, kood/Jõhvi students can engage in comprehensive audits that foster a collaborative learning environment and encourage continuous improvement in project development.
