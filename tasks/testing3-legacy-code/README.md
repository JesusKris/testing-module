# Testing Legacy code | JavaScript | 1


## Learning outcomes

Your learning outcomes will be:
- Reading code written by other people
- Testing legacy code

There will be a tricky piece of existing code (function, etc) that has to be tested by a student



## Introduction

Often, in real life scenarios, a software developer is presented with a large existing code base.  
Such legacy code often lacks automated tests.  
To improve maintainability and quality, it is useful to add tests to legacy code.  
This task simulates just such a scenario of adding tests to existing code.

## Objectives

This section should introduce the task to the student in depth.

## Instructions

This section should guide the student through the necessary actions and provide any specific requirements or considerations. 


## Usage *optional*

This section should contain example outputs of a completed program.

## Allowed packages/technologies *optional*

This section should contain list of allowed packages/technologies the student must/could use for their project.

## Advice

This section should contain links to any helpful sources so that the student has a starting point and does not feel completely lost.
